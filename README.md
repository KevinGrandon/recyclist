# Recyclist

Recyclist is a small javascript library for efficient scrolling of lists. Recyclist works by recycling nodes which are off the viewport and re-positioning them with absolute coordinates to avoid reflows.

This is based off of the approach that Robert O'Callahan described here: http://robert.ocallahan.org/2014/02/implementing-virtual-widgets-on-web.html
